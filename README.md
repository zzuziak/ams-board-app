The app let's you add, organize and delete the tasks on a project-flow board.

In the project root directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

In the project backend directory initiate the database (make sure your user has `read` and `write` permissions for the db):
### `mongod`

And start your nodemon server:
### `nodemon server`

If the message in console say that both server and connection to the database were successfully established - you're good to go!
